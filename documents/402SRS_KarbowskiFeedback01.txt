Ancur Project SRS Evaluation
============================

Nice job on this, a great beginning.

Some suggestions.

When thinking of requirements, try to be even more specific about what
you are specifying.  For a project of this magnitude and intent, you need
a LOT more requirements, and a LOT more detail.  Whatever you are going
to code up needs to be specified.  For example, it's not enough to say,
"The GUI shall provide a way for users to choose a document to validate."
Instead you should say, "The GUI shall provide a button for users to
click to choose a document to validate."

If something *might* happen, that belongs in a "should" or a "will"
statement, which is associated with a "shall" statement.  For example,
you state:

5.2.1.3. The GUI might allow users to store the validated documents.

Instead you should say:

5.2.1.3. The GUI shall handle storage of any validated document.
         Document storage should be implemented in a future release.
         Document storage details will be deferred to a later phase.

Notice that the should and will statements are NOT numbered and follow the
"shall" statement with which they are associated.

Having a document to specify something like this project that only has 5
functional requirement statements is really not enough.

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
