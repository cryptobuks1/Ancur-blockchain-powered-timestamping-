### 4.1 Plan Introduction  
This Software Development Plan provides the detail of the planned development for the Ancur web application that provides an application allowing users to validate documents on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.  

Ancur uses the Stampery API to embed hashes associated with documents into the blockchain - the process is called *stamping*. This process provides the user with a *receipt* for the blockchain being used and each *receipt* has all the necessary data for proving the validity of the stamped document - *id*, *token*, *bitcoin receipt*, *ethereum receipt*, *timestamp*, *hash*, ... . Ancur is an application that utilizes blockchain technology to provide users with a secure way to validate their documents on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.

#### 4.1.1 Project Deliverables  
* **Project Proposal - *week 2***
    * This document provides a description and justification of the application.
* **Initial Requirements Specification Document - *week 5***
    * This document specifies exactly what is going to and is being built. It is a contract between the customer and the solution provider.
    * The document includes functional, performance, and environment requirements.
* **Initial Software Development Plan - *week 9***
    * This document describes a plan for the process that will be used during the semester.
    * It includes the plan introduction, project deliverables, project resources, hardware resources, software resources, project organization, project schedule, PERT / GANTT chart, task / resource table, and a class schedule.
* **Oral Status Reports - *every week from week 9 onward***
    * Weekly SCRUMs explaining what has been accomplished since the last week, what is currently being worked on, what is going to be completed by the next SCRUM, and any blockers/problems.
* **Written Status Reports - *every other week from week 9 onward***
    * These reports outline the accomplishments made since the last report, any noteworthy risks/problems/concerns, and the tasks scheduled for completion by the next report.
* **Updated Software Development Plan - *week 11***
    * An updated version of the Initial Software Development Plan.
* **Updated Requirements Specification Document - *week 13***
    * An updated version of the Initial Requirements Specification Document.
* **Preliminary Demo Presentations - *week 13-15***
    * A demonstration of the application to the class.
* **Final Product Delivery and Presentation - *week 17***
    * Final report and code for the application are due.  

### 4.2 Project Resources  
#### 4.2.1 Hardware Resources
###### Development Machine  
An Apple laptop is used for the development of the application with the following attributes:
* MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2013)
* 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5
* 8 GB RAM - 2 GB minimum required for execution

###### Online Application Host  
A website will be the platform used for the application. This is where the features will be available to the users.
* HTML 5 Support
* Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge(Internet Explorer)  

#### 4.2.2 Software Resources
###### Text Editor
* Atom v1.23.3  

###### Interpreter and Executer
* Node v8.9.4  

###### Version Control
* Git v2.11.0  

###### Third Party Software
* [Stampery API](https://stampery.com/)

###### Operating System
* macOS Sierra v10.12.3  

### 4.3 Project Organization
#### Major Functionality of the Application:
* **Frontend/UI design**
    * The design of the frontend is simple and to the point.
    * Styling and design is being completed as I go.
    * Familiarize with React working in cohesion with Redux.  
    *The frontend and design of the application will be implemented throughout the duration of the semester*
* **Research APIs**
    * Determine the best API to connect to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.  
    *Completed by week 5*
    * Stampery allows users to integrate data certification and timestamping into their own application and connects applications to their infinitely scalable Blockchain Timestamping Architecture. The timestamps and proofs generated by this API are independently verifiable at no cost and will be valid forever. Each proof connects stamped hashes to a transaction contained in the next Ethereum and Bitcoin block.
* **Implement stamping feature**
    * Allows users to select a file from their computer to be stamped.  
    *Implemented by week 9*
    * Provide users with a downloadable file containing their stamped document's *id*, *token*, *time*, *hash*, and *receipts* - (Bitcoin and Ethereum receipts).  
    *Implement by week 12-13*
* **Implement proving feature**
    * Allows the user to enter a stamped document's *id* to be proved.  
    *Scheduled for implementation by week 10, blockers delayed implementation until week 11*
    * Displays confirmation or denial depending on if the *id* matches a stamped document or not.  
    *Implement by week 13-14*
* **Testing**
    * The remainder of the time will be used to perfect the application.
