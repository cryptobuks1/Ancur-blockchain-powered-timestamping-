Invest in Arup application

**Project Overview**  
*Aim:*
The aim of the project is to utilize blockchain technology to store document verifications securely on a blockchain. The project is centered around the production of a validation and the storage of that validation on the blockchain. The final deliverable will be a web application that allows users to choose documents to be verified and allows users to view previous validations. Additionally, the project will require research to determine the best tools and APIs to implement this application efficiently.  

*Context:*
The project is inspired by the exponential advancement of blockchain technologies within the past year. It would be ideal to work on this project because validating data on the blockchain is one of the most secure options available. The project would take advantage of the blockchain’s decentralized database and peer-to-peer network to ensure information is shared and continually updated. Additional security would be ensured since transactions made to the blockchain are immutable once verified.  

*Value:*
This project will demonstrate one of the many possible applications that could be built using blockchain technologies, and the benefits blockchain technologies provide. Additionally this project will allow the exploration of new data storage techniques.
